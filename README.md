To see the endpoint deployed and the answer for the "input" variable inside "predict-test.py" you need to install:
 
1. Docker engine
2. Python
3. Requests python package (pip install requests) 

Then you have to be in the repo folder and after that can execute "docker-compose up" and then execute "python predict-test.py" and you will see the response printed for the "input" variable inside  "predict-test.py" file.
